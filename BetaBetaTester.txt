As a beta user, I downloaded and installed Recipe Buddy v17 Beta 2. I launched the program and was presented with a menu with six options:

View Recipe
Add a recipe
Submit Recipes
Display all recipes
Edit a recipe
Quit
I selected option 2 to add a new recipe. I entered the name of the recipe and then was prompted to enter the ingredients and steps for the recipe. I entered the ingredients and steps and then the recipe was saved to the program.

Next, I selected option 4 to display all recipes. The program showed me a list of all the recipes that had been added, including the one I just added.

Finally, I selected option 6 to quit the program.

Here is an example of the program being used:
